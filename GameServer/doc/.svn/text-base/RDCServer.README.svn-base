== 1. How it works ? ==
RDC Server is a socket-based engine listening
on one or several network interfaces, and designed
to serve real-time game data to remote client,
using XML standardized-format.
After authenticated based on configuration password,
client sends a string identifying his request, which
described what data to be served. Server parses that
request and queries data across the emulator classes,
then builds an output xml file and sends it through
the socket. EOF tag then close connection.

== 2. How to use ? ==
--- Enable RDC server through gameserver.properties and
tune network settings according to your infrastructure.
--- Start GameServer.
--- Start a telnet session to the IP:port specified in
configuration. If you receive the "ATH-KY:" prompt, it
means RDC server is online and ready for requests.
--- Use any of available client libraries to interface
your client platform language with RDC server.
